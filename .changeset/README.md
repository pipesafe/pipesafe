# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can find the full documentation for it [in the repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common steps to help you get started:

## Adding a changeset

To add a changeset, run `bun run changeset`. This will prompt you with a few questions and then generate a changeset file for you.
